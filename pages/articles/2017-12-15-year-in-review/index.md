## Looking Back

It's hard to believe that Christmas is just a week away and we are almost done with 2017. This time of year, at least for me, is a time of reflection on the year gone by. It seems like it was just yesterday that I had published my goals for this year.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Selecting a JS Framework

For me, I knew that learning JS Framework was definately where the web is headed and I wanted to catch a ride on this train. But which framework to start with? I was overwhelmed and did what I thought was best and that was to spend a little time with each one.

I started with Angular since it was really all of talk about it from VS Studio Live Conference I had attended. It paired nicely with Typescript and seemed like many speakers at the conference where talking about it and hyping it. I listed to //TODO: insert author name// speak and how the Angular team all used vscode and how the Google team was working with the MS team. Seemed like a good place to start but I had found that it was not a rabbit hole that I wanted to go down.

Next I learned that Jeffrey Way had realeased a course on Vue. I really love Jeffrey's teaching style and respect him as a teacher and as a person.  I really liked how simple it was to get started.

Next I was introduced to Wes Bos and his online courses, some free and some you had to pay for. Well I found that he was someone that had quality training after taking some of the 30 Day JS Challenge. I soon started his Intro to React coure and really liked that is was just JS and felt that by learning React it was making me a better JS developer too.

So my coworker used React on one of our projects at work and I remember thinking this feels like magic. I was hooked ever since. I want to continue learning React in 2018 and this is where my heart is after trying the big three JS frameworks in 2017.

I feel like it was good for me to at least try all 3. Not at the same time, but complete one project in one framework and see how it felt. Then you can make a decision on which one you like working with, wich one you feel comfortable with, and which one you are most productive with.
