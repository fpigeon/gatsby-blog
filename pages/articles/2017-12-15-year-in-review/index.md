## Looking Back

It's hard to believe that Christmas is just a week away and we are almost done with 2017. This time of year, at least for me, is a time of reflection on the year gone by. It seems like it was just yesterday that I had published my goals for this year.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Selecting a JS Framework

For me, I knew that learning JS Framework was definately where the web is headed and I wanted to catch a ride on this train. But which framework to start with? I was overwhelmed and did what I thought was best and that was to spend a little time with each one.

I started with Angular since it was really all of talk about it from VS Studio Live Conference I had attended. It paired nicely with Typescript and seemed like many speakers at the conference where talking about it and hyping it. I listed to //TODO: insert author name// speak and how the Angular team all used vscode and how the Google team was working with the MS team. Seemed like a good place to start but I had found that it was not a rabbit hole that I wanted to go down.

Next I learned that Jeffrey Way had realeased a course on Vue. I really love Jeffrey's teaching style and respect him as a teacher and as a person.  I really liked how simple it was to get started.

Next I was introduced to Wes Bos and his online courses, some free and some you had to pay for. Well I found that he was someone that had quality training after taking some of the 30 Day JS Challenge. I soon started his Intro to React coure and really liked that is was just JS and felt that by learning React it was making me a better JS developer too.

So my coworker used React on one of our projects at work and I remember thinking this feels like magic. I was hooked ever since. I want to continue learning React in 2018 and this is where my heart is after trying the big three JS frameworks in 2017.

I feel like it was good for me to at least try all 3. Not at the same time, but complete one project in one framework and see how it felt. Then you can make a decision on which one you like working with, wich one you feel comfortable with, and which one you are most productive with.

### Freelancing

Had a few opportunities with my side business but the opportunities didn't pan out.  At least, I had forged a strategic alliance with Paul Castillo and am excited to see what 2018 has to offer.

### Dokku

I probably need to do a seperate blog post on Dokku to give it justice.

From the docs:

> Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen.

I had not worked with Heroku but have read that it makes deploying apps in whatever language dead simple.

I had used Talyor Otwell's PaaS but I was limited to PHP based projects. Now that I am using Dokku, I can deploy apps in any language to my Digital Ocean droplet.

### Interviews

My dev shop was hiring two developer positions and I was selected to be on the interview panel. It was the first time I had been on the other side of the table and was honored to be there. We were asked to come up with five questions and the panel, which consisted of four members would take turns asking questions.

This experience helped me learn that this field is hard, and being put on the spot to answer technical questions can be daunting to say the least. I have been in those shoes and know that it can be tough. I remember from being on the Army's promotion board that even if you dont' know the answer, say you know where to find the answer. Also enthusiasm goes along way. People skills are important since you will have to work with this person.

## Best Upgrades

2017 had a many upgrades but these are top favs!

### Standing Desk

I had the opportunity to get a standing desk for work. At first, I wasn't sure if I even wanted it but I decided that I would give it a try.

I had read of the benefits of standing and was trying to improve my health so this was a win for me.

At first my legs would get weak and I could only stand for like maybe an hour or so. But after a few weeks, I was standing more and sitting less.

Now I find that I am standing all morning, and then sit down for lunch and the afternoon.

I also gave my chair for a medicine ball and feel that I am working my core more noe than just sitting in a chair.

## Exercise as part of a routine

I wasn't in the habit of working out and had found that I even when I went I wasn't very seriuos about it.

Now I am commited to working out as part of my day. There is no question of what my plans are for lunch. I know and I plan on working out.

I feel that this commmitment has help me focus more on my dev work and stay more balanced.
